## Introduction

This README will provide a baseline introduction into the Secure Cloud Architecture (SCA). Links will be provided for more in-depth explanations.


## Secure Cloud Architecture

Focusing on delivering a concept to migrate to the cloud with security as a priority, not an after thought

## Design principles

Security is built-in, â€¦

## Business Outcomes

## What is included in this template? 

The Secure Cloud Architecture (SCA) provides a 3-Tier architecture. This architecture has the following components:

5 subnets:
1. Management 
2. "Outside" 
3. DMZ #1
4. DMZ #2 
5. "Internal" 

**Below is an image of the architecture:** <br> <br>

<br> 


Tier 1 and Tier 3 are F5 BIG-IP devices (HA via API), while Tier 2 IPS is a Ubuntu box with routing enabled. The reason of this is to allow flexibility in Tier 2 so that the customer is not locked into a F5 device. 

There is a root Cloud Formation Template (CFT) which runs many child CFT's. <br>

<br>


1. The TGW (transit gateway) and VPC (virtual private cloud) are deployed.
2. The template for the jump host and IPS to be deployed. 
3. BIG-IP is deployed in Tier 1 and Tier 3. <br>
**Note**: This is created after the jump host and IPS because 1 of the inputs to this is a private IP of the jump host
4. Routes are replaced utilizing lambda functions since it's not natively allowed
5. The AS3 Update template updates AS3
